## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Bike Yard?">
    Bike Yard is a lead generation platform that connects bike shops with buyers actively searching for bikes. Unlike marketplace sites, we don't process transactions — buyers browse your listings and contact you directly. No transaction fees, no commissions, just quality leads.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    We offer two subscription plans:

    - **Bike Yard Lite** — $80/month for up to 10 bike listings
    - **Bike Yard Pro** — $120/month for up to 200 bike listings

    Both plans include full 99spokes integration, shop profile page, analytics, and direct customer enquiries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I sign up?">
    Visit [bikeyard.com.au/join](https://bikeyard.com.au/join) to choose your plan and create your account. After payment, you'll receive a welcome email with your login credentials.
  </Accordion>

## Adding Bikes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does it take to add a bike?">
    Under 1 minute! Our 99 Spokes integration automatically imports all bike specifications. You just search, select, add your price, and publish.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a bike isn't in the 99spokes database?">
    Contact us at support@bikeyard.com.au — we can often get it added. Or choose the manual entry option above the 99 Spokes search box.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import bikes from my existing inventory system?">
    Currently, bikes are added individually via 99spokes search. Bulk import features are planned for a future release.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need one listing per bike?">
    Yes. Each physical bike you have in stock needs its own listing. This means:
    - Multiple units of the same model = separate listings
    - Same model in different sizes = separate listings
    - Same model in different colours = separate listings

    This ensures buyers can find exactly what they're looking for.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I list multiple of the same bike quickly?">
    Use the **Duplicate** feature! In your My Bikes table, click Duplicate on any listing. This copies all the specs and creates a new draft — just update the size, colour, or price and publish.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Listings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I mark a bike as sold?">
    When a bike sells, **archive** the listing to remove it from search while keeping your analytics history.

    **From your dashboard:**
    1. Go to **My Bikes**
    2. Click the **Archive** button next to the listing

    **From your phone:**
    Use the Bike Yard app to archive bikes instantly from the shop floor—swipe left on any listing to archive it.

    Archived listings don't count toward your listing limit and can be restored anytime if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when my subscription expires?">
    Your listings will be hidden from search results but not deleted. Renewing your subscription will restore them immediately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple staff members managing listings?">
    Currently, one login per shop. Multi-user access is on our roadmap.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    No refunds for partial billing periods. Cancel before your renewal date to avoid being charged.
