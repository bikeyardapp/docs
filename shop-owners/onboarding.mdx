## What is Bike Yard?

- Shop website URL

Use the "Import from Google My Business" feature to auto-fill most of your shop details in seconds!
</Tip>

  <Step title="Go to Shop Profile">
    Navigate to your Shop Profile page in the dashboard
  </Step>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Your Shop">
    Type your shop name and click "Search"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Shop">
    Click on your shop from the search results

</Steps>

### Step 3: Add Your First Bike

This is where Bike Yard shines. Adding a bike takes **1 minute or less** using our 99spokes integration.

#### Quick Add Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search">
    Type the bike brand and model (e.g., "Specialized Tarmac" or "Giant Defy")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select">
    Click on the correct bike from the search results
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    Check the auto-populated specifications
  </Step>
  <Step title="Price">
    Enter YOUR selling price, size, and colour
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    Click "Publish Bike Listing"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your bike is now live and searchable by buyers across Australia.

#### One Listing Per Bike

Each physical bike you have in stock needs its own listing on Bike Yard. This means:

- **Multiple units of the same model** — each one gets its own listing
- **Same model in different sizes** — each size gets its own listing
- **Same model in different colours** — each colour gets its own listing

This approach ensures buyers see exactly what's available and can find the specific bike they're looking for.

<Tip>
**Use the Duplicate feature!** To save time when listing multiple units of the same bike, use the **Duplicate** button in your My Bikes table. This copies all the bike's specs and creates a new draft listing — just update the size, colour, or price and publish. Much faster than starting from scratch!
</Tip>

## Managing Your Listings

### Your Dashboard

Your dashboard gives you a quick overview of:

- Total active listings
- Recent views across all bikes
- Recent enquiries
- Quick links to add/manage bikes

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/onboarding-dashboard-overview.png" alt="Dashboard Overview" />
</Frame>

### My Bikes

View all your listings in one place:

- **Status** — Published, Draft, or Sold
- **Views** — How many times each bike has been viewed
- **Enquiries** — Number of contact requests received
- **Actions** — Edit, duplicate, or mark as sold

### Duplicating a Listing

Got multiple units of the same bike? Here's how to quickly duplicate a listing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to My Bikes">
    Navigate to your My Bikes page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Listing">
    Locate the listing you want to copy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Duplicate">
    Click the **Duplicate** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the Copy">
    A new draft listing is created with "(Copy)" in the title. Update the size, colour, price, or add photos
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    Click **Publish** when ready
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The duplicate feature copies all bike specs but resets analytics to zero and doesn't copy any boost status. Your featured image is shared between listings (not duplicated) to save storage.
</Tip>

### Editing a Listing

Need to update a price or mark a bike as sold?

1. Go to **My Bikes**
2. Find the listing you want to edit
3. Click **Edit**
4. Make your changes
5. Click **Update**

<Tip>
When a bike sells, change the status to "Sold" — this removes it from search results while keeping your history intact.
</Tip>

## Listing Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do's ✓" icon="check" color="#30a46c">
    - Create one listing per bike
    - List bikes you have in stock
    - Keep prices current
    - Use the duplicate feature for multiple units
    - Use accurate descriptions
    - Respond quickly to enquiries
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don'ts ✗" icon="xmark" color="#e5484d">
    - List bikes you can't supply
    - Use as general advertising
    - Leave sold bikes as "In Stock"
    - Ignore enquiries
    - Put multiple sizes in one listing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Listing bikes that aren't genuinely available damages trust with buyers and Bike Yard's reputation. Repeated violations may result in account suspension.
</Warning>

## Understanding Your Analytics

### Views

Every time a buyer views your bike listing, it counts as a view. High views but low enquiries? Consider:

- Is your price competitive?
- Is your description complete?
- Are your shop details filled in?

### Enquiries

When a buyer submits an enquiry form or clicks to call/email, it's tracked as an enquiry. This is your key metric — enquiries are leads that can convert to sales.

### Conversion Tips

- Respond to enquiries within 2 hours if possible
- Include all relevant information in your listings
- Keep your shop phone answered during business hours
- Have your team aware that Bike Yard leads are coming in

## Bike Boost (Optional)

Want extra visibility for a specific bike? Use **Bike Boost**:

- **$20** for 14 days of featured placement
- Bike appears in "Featured Bikes" section
- Higher visibility in search results
- Available on any listing

Perfect for clearing out ex-demo stock, promoting sale items, or highlighting new arrivals.
