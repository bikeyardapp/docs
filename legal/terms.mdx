## 2. Description of Service

### 2.1 Platform Overview

Bike Yard is a lead generation platform that enables bicycle retailers ("Shops" or "Subscribers") to list their available bike inventory. Prospective purchasers ("Buyers") can browse listings and contact Shops directly. Bike Yard does not facilitate, process, or handle any transactions between Shops and Buyers.

### 2.2 No E-Commerce

Bike Yard is expressly NOT an e-commerce platform. We do not:
- Process payments for bicycle purchases;
- Act as an intermediary in sales transactions;
- Guarantee any transaction between Shops and Buyers;
- Hold funds or provide escrow services; or
- Take any commission on sales.

### 2.3 Lead Generation Only

The Service is designed solely to connect Shops with potential Buyers. All negotiations, terms of sale, warranties, delivery, and after-sales support occur directly between Shops and Buyers, entirely outside of the Bike Yard platform.

## 3. Account Registration

### 3.1 Account Creation

To list bikes on Bike Yard, you must create a Subscriber account and maintain an active subscription. You agree to:
- Provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration;
- Maintain and promptly update your account information;
- Maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials;
- Accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account; and
- Notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of your account.

### 3.2 One Account Per Business

Each business may maintain only one Subscriber account. Multiple accounts for the same business are prohibited and may result in termination of all associated accounts.

### 3.3 Account Verification

We reserve the right to verify your identity and business credentials at any time. You agree to provide reasonable documentation upon request.

## 4. Subscriptions and Payment

### 4.1 Subscription Plans

Access to listing features requires an active paid subscription. Subscription plans, pricing, and features are described on our website and may be modified from time to time.

### 4.2 Billing

Subscriptions are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the plan selected. All amounts are in Australian Dollars (AUD) and include GST where applicable.

### 4.3 Payment Processing

Payments are processed by our third-party payment processor, Stripe. By subscribing, you agree to Stripe's terms of service. We do not store complete credit card information on our servers.

### 4.4 Automatic Renewal

Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless cancelled before the renewal date. You authorise us to charge your designated payment method for renewal fees.

### 4.5 Cancellation

You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account dashboard. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods.

### 4.6 Price Changes

We may modify subscription pricing upon 30 days' notice. Price changes will take effect at your next renewal date. Your continued subscription after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.

### 4.7 Failed Payments

If a payment fails, we may suspend access to listing features. We will attempt to notify you and may retry the payment. Continued payment failure may result in account suspension or termination.

- Contain viruses, malware, or other harmful code;
- Be defamatory, obscene, offensive, or otherwise objectionable;

---

## 6. Listing Requirements and Standards

### 6.1 Accurate Listings

All bike listings must accurately represent:

- Bikes that are genuinely available for purchase;
- Current pricing;
- Actual condition of the bike (new, ex-demo, used);
- Available sizes and colours; and
- Stock availability status.

### 6.2 Prohibited Listings

You must NOT list:

- Bikes you do not have available and on-hand to sell;
- Stolen goods or goods obtained illegally;
- Counterfeit products or products that infringe intellectual property rights;
- Products that do not comply with Australian safety standards;
- Items that are not bicycles or directly related bicycle products; or
- Listings primarily intended to drive traffic to external sites without genuine intent to sell the listed bike.

### 6.3 Timely Updates

You must:

- Update or remove listings promptly when bikes are sold;
- Keep pricing current and accurate;
- Respond to buyer enquiries in a timely manner; and
- Maintain accurate shop profile information.

### 6.4 Listing Integrity Policy

To maintain the quality and trustworthiness of the Bike Yard marketplace, we enforce a strict policy against misleading listings. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Listing bicycles that are not genuinely available for sale at the time of listing;
- Advertising bicycles at prices significantly below the actual selling price with the intent to attract enquiries (commonly known as "bait pricing");
- Any other conduct designed to mislead potential buyers or artificially generate enquiries.

**'Three Stikes' Enforcement**

Where we determine, at our sole discretion, that a Subscriber has breached this Listing Integrity Policy, the following consequences will apply:

(a) **First Breach:** A formal written warning will be issued to the Subscriber. The offending listing(s) will be removed.

(b) **Second Breach:** The Subscriber's account will be suspended for a period of seven (7) days. During suspension, all listings will be hidden from public view and the Subscriber will be unable to create new listings or receive enquiries.

(c) **Third Breach:** The Subscriber's account will be suspended for a period of one (1) calendar month. During suspension, all listings will be hidden from public view and the Subscriber will be unable to create new listings or receive enquiries.

(d) **Subsequent Breaches:** We reserve the right to terminate the Subscriber's account in accordance with clause 9 (Termination).

For the avoidance of doubt, subscription fees remain payable during any period of account suspension and no refunds or credits will be issued for suspension periods resulting from breaches of this policy.
